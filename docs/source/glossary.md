REST
    REST stands for [Representational State Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). It is a software architectural principle to create loosely coupled web APIs.

workflow
    A concept in Plone (and other CMS's) whereby a content object can be in a number of states (private, public, etcetera) and uses transitions to change between them (e.g. "publish", "approve", "reject", "retract"). See the [Plone docs on Workflow](https://5.docs.plone.org/working-with-content/collaboration-and-workflow/)

HTTP-Request
HTTP Request
Request
Requests
    The initial action performed by a web client to communicate with a server. The {term}`Request` is usually followed by a {term}`Response` by the server, either synchronous or asynchronous (which is more complex to handle on the user side)

HTTP-Response
HTTP Response
Response
    Answer of or action by the server that is executed or send to the client after the {term}`Request` is processed.

HTTP-Header
HTTP Header
Header
    The part of the communication of the client with the server that provides the initialisation of the communication of a {term}`Request`.

HTTP-Verb
HTTP Verb
Verb
    One of the basic actions that can be requested to be executed by the server (on an object) based on the {term}`Request`.

Object URL
    The target object of the {term}`Request`.

Authorization Header
    Part of the {term}`Request` that is responsible for the authentication related to the right user or service to ask for a {term}`Response`.

Accept Header
    Part of the {term}`Request` that is responsible to define the expected type of data to be accepted by the client in the {term}`Response`.

Authentication Method
    Access restriction provided by the connection chain to the server exposed to the client.

Basic Auth
    A simple {term}`Authentication Method` referenced in the {term}`Authorization Header` that needs to be provided by the server.

content rule
    A content rule will automatically perform an action when a certain event, known as a {term}`trigger`, takes place.

trigger
    A trigger is an event in Plone that causes the execution of defined actions.
    Example triggers include object modified, user logged in, and workflow state changed.

navigation root
    An object marked as a navigation root provides a way to root catalog queries, searches, breadcrumbs, and so on, into that object.
