# Control Panels

Control panels in Plone allow you to configure the global site setup of a Plone site.
The `@controlpanels` endpoint in `plone.restapi` allows you to list all existing control panels in a Plone site, and to retrieve or edit the settings of a specific control panel.

Most of the settings in the Plone control panels are based on `plone.registry` since Plone 5.x.
Therefore, you can also use the `@registry` endpoint to retrieve or manipulate site settings.
The `@controlpanels` endpoint is a more convenient way of accessing the settings, and makes it
easier to render control panels on the front-end.

```{note}
The `@controlpanels` endpoint is implemented for Plone 5 or greater.
```


## Listing Control Panels

A list of all existing control panels in the portal can be retrieved by sending a `GET` request to the `@controlpanels` endpoint:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get.resp
:language: http
```

The following fields are returned:

- `@id`: hypermedia link to the control panel
- `title`: the title of the control panel
- `group`: the group in which the control panel should appear, for example, `General`, `Content`, `Users`, `Security`, `Advanced`, or `Add-on Configuration`.


## Retrieve a single Control Panel

To retrieve a single control panel, send a `GET` request to the URL of the control panel:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_item.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_item.resp
:language: http
```

The following fields are returned:

- `@id`: hypermedia link to the control panel
- `title`: title of the control panel
- `group`: group name of the control panel
- `schema`: JSON Schema of the control panel
- `data`: current values of the control panel


## Updating a Control Panel with `PATCH`

To update the settings on a control panel, send a `PATCH` request to control panel resource:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_patch.req
```

A successful response to a `PATCH` request will be indicated by a {term}`204 No Content` response:


```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_patch.resp
:language: http
```


## Control Panels not based on `plone.registry`

Control panels which are not based on `plone.registry` have a custom `@controlpanels/:panel` endpoint implementation.


(dexterity-types)=

### Dexterity Types

`@controlpanels/dexterity-types` is a custom control panel endpoint that will allow you to add, remove, and configure available {ref}`types`.

Reading or writing Dexterity content types require the `plone.schemaeditor.ManageSchemata` permission.

| Verb     | URL                                         | Action                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types`           | List configurable content types           |
| `POST`   | `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types`           | Creates a new content type                |
| `GET`    | `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types/{type-id}` | Get the current state of the content type |
| `PATCH`  | `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types/{type-id}` | Update the content type details           |
| `DELETE` | `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types/{type-id}` | Remove the content type                       |


#### Listing Dexterity Content Types

To list the available content types, send a `GET` request to `@controlpanels/dexterity-types`

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_dexterity.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_dexterity.resp
:language: http
```

The following fields are returned:

- `@id`: hypermedia link to the control panel
- `title`: title of the control panel
- `group`: group name of the control panel
- `schema`: JSON Schema of the control panel
- `data`: current values of the control panel
- `items`: list of configurable content types


#### Creating a new Dexterity Type with `POST`

To create a new content type, send a `POST` request to the `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types` endpoint:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_post_dexterity_item.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_post_dexterity_item.resp
:language: http
```


#### Reading a Dexterity Type with `GET`

After a successful `POST`, access the content type by sending a `GET` request to the endpoint `/@controlpanels/dexterity-types/{type-id}`:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_dexterity_item.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_get_dexterity_item.resp
:language: http
```


#### Updating a Dexterity Type with `PATCH`

To update an existing content type, send a `PATCH` request to the server.
`PATCH` allows to provide just a subset of the resource, that is, the values you actually want to change:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_patch_dexterity_item.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_patch_dexterity_item.resp
:language: http
```


#### Removing a Dexterity Type with `DELETE`

Delete an existing content type by sending a `DELETE` request to the URL of an existing content type:

```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_delete_dexterity_item.req
```

Response:

```{literalinclude} ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/controlpanels_delete_dexterity_item.resp
:language: http
```
