Tiles
=====

..note::

  The tiles endpoint currently match only partially (the GET endpoints) the default Plone implementation.
  The serialization of tiles didn't match the Mosaic (and plone.app.blocks) implementation and it's done to
  not rely on those technologies. The serialization of the tile information on objects are subject to change in
  the future to extend or improve features.

A tile is an HTML snippet that can contain arbitrary content (e.g. text, images, videos).

The @tiles endpoint is context specific.
Called on the portal root it will list all available tiles,
and allows to retrieve the JSON schema for those tiles.

If called on a content object, it will return the tiles that are actually stored on that content object.

Listing available tiles
-----------------------

List all available tiles type by sending a GET request to the @tiles endpoint on the portal roots::

  GET /plone/@tiles HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0

The server responds with a `Status 200` and list all available tiles::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  [
    {
      "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/@tiles/title",
      "title": "Title tile",
      "description": "A field tile that will show the title of the content object",
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/@tiles/description",
      "title": "Description tile",
      "description": "A field tile that will show the description of the content object",
    },
  ]

Retrieve Tile JSON schema
-------------------------

Retrieve the JSON schema of a specific tile by calling the '@tiles' endpoint with the id of the tile::

  GET /plone/@tiles/title HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0

The server responds with a JSON schema definition for that particular tile::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json+schema

  {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "description": "",
        "title": "Title",
        "type": "string"
      },
      ...
    },
    "required": [
      "title",
    ],
    "title": "Title Tile",
    "type": "object"
  }


Retrieving tiles on a content object
------------------------------------

Retrieve a list of tiles stored on a content object by calling the @tiles endpoint on a content object::

  GET /plone/my-document/@tiles HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0

The server responds with a `Status 200` and list all stored tiles on that content object::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/my-document",
    ...
    "tiles": [
      {
        "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/my-document/@tiles/my-title",
        "type": "title",
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/my-document/@tiles/my-description",
        "type": "description",
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/my-document/@tiles/image-1",
        "type": "image",
        "data": {
          "image": "<some random url>",
          "caption": "My pony",
        },
      },
      {
        "type": "image",
        "data": {
          "image": "<some random url>",
          "caption": "My cow",
        },
      },
    ]
  }


Fetching tiles on an object
---------------------------
Tiles data are stored in the objects via a Dexterity behavior `plone.tiles`. It has two attributes that stores existing tiles in the object (`tiles`) and the current layout (`arrangement`).
As it's a dexterity behavior, both attributes will be returned in a simple GET::

  GET /plone/my-document HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "@id": "http://localhost:55001/plone/my-document",
    ...
    "arrangement": [
      "#title-1",
      "#description-1",
      "#image-1"
    ],
    "tiles": {
      "#title-1": {
        "@type": "title"
      },
      "#description-1": {
        "@type": "Description"
      },
      "#image-1": {
        "@type": "Image",
        "image": "<some random url>"
      }
    }
  }

Tiles objects will contain the tile metadata and the information to render it.


Adding tiles to an object
-------------------------

Storing tiles is done also via a default PATCH content operation.

  PATCH /plone/my-document HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "arrangement": [
      "#title-1",
      "#description-1",
      "#image-1"
    ],
    "tiles": {
      "#title-1": {
        "@type": "title"
      },
      "#description-1": {
        "@type": "Description"
      },
      "#image-1": {
        "@type": "Image",
        "image": "<some random url>"
      }
    }
  }

If the tile has been added, the server responds with a `204` status code.


Saving tiles data (proposal)
-----------------------------

..note::

  This is not implemented (yet) in the arrangement field, but it's a proposal on
  how could look like in the future.

They might be serialized using this structure:

```json
[
  [
    id: UUID,
    columns: [
      {
        id: UUID, // column UUID
        size: int // the size of the column
        rows: [
          {
            id: UUID, // inner row UUID
            cells: [
              {
                id: UUID, // cell UUID
                component: string
                content: {
                  // tile fields serialization
                },
                size: int
              },
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
    ]
  ], // row 1
  [], // row 2
]
```

It tries to match the usual way of CSS frameworks to map grid systems. So we have:

row (orderables up/down) -> column (resizables on width) -> row -> cell (actual tile content)

Rows are orderable vertically, columns resizables horizontally and cells can be
moved around to an specific inner row.
