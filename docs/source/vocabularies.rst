Vocabularies
============

Vocabularies are utilities containing a list of values grouped by interest or
different Plone features. For example,
``plone.app.vocabularies.ReallyUserFriendlyTypes`` will return all the content
types registered in Plone. The vocabularies return a list of objects with the
items ``@id``, ``title`` and ``token``.

.. note::
	These docs are generated by code tests, therefore you will see some 'test' contenttypes appear here.

Get all vocabularies
--------------------

To get a list of all the available content types, you can query using a GET to the @vocabulary endpoint:

..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: _json/vocabularies.req

The response will include a list with all the dotted names of the available
vocabularies in Plone.

.. literalinclude:: _json/vocabularies.resp
   :language: http

Get a vocabulary
----------------

To get a particular vocabulary, ``/@vocabularies`` endpoint
with the name of the vocabulary, e.g.
``/plone/@vocabularies/plone.app.vocabularies.ReallyUserFriendlyTypes``. The
endpoint can be used with the site root and content objects. The right way is
depending on the implementation of the vocabulary.

..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: _json/vocabularies_get.req

The server will respond with a list of terms. The title is pureley for display purposes. The token is what should be send to the server to retrive the value of the term.

.. literalinclude:: _json/vocabularies_get.resp
   :language: http
