Serialization
=============

Throughout the REST API, content needs to be serialized and deserialized to and from JSON representations.

In general, the format used for serializing content when reading from the API is the same as is used to submit content to the API for writing.

Basic Types
-----------

Basic Python data types that have a corresponding type in JSON, like integers or strings, will simply be translated between the Python type and the respective JSON type.

Dates and Times
---------------

Since JSON doesn't have native support for dates/times, the Python/Zope datetime types will be serialized to an ISO 8601 datestring.

======================================= ======================================
Python                                  JSON
======================================= ======================================
``time(19, 45, 55)``                    ``'19:45:55'``
``date(2015, 11, 23)``                  ``'2015-11-23'``
``datetime(2015, 11, 23, 19, 45, 55)``  ``'2015-11-23T19:45:55'``
``DateTime('2015/11/23 19:45:55')``     ``'2015-11-23T19:45:55'``
======================================= ======================================


RichText fields
---------------

RichText fields will be serialized as follows:

A ``RichTextValue`` like

.. code-block:: python

    RichTextValue(u'<p>Hall√∂chen</p>',
                  mimeType='text/html',
                  outputMimeType='text/html')

will be serialized to

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "data": "<p>Hall\u00f6chen</p>",
      "content-type": "text/html",
      "encoding": "utf-8"
    }

File / Image Fields
-------------------

Download (serialization)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For download, a file field will be serialized to a mapping that contains the
file's most basic metadata, and a hyperlink that the client can follow to
download the file:

.. code-block:: json

      {
        "...": "",
        "@type": "File",
        "title": "My file",
        "file": {
          "content-type": "application/pdf",
          "download": "http://localhost:55001/plone/file/@@download/file",
          "filename": "file.pdf",
          "size": 74429
        }
      }

That URL in the ``download`` property points to the regular Plone download
view. The client can send a ``GET`` request to that URL with an ``Accept``
header containing the MIME type indicated in the ``content-type`` property,
and will get a response containing the file.

Image fields are serialized in the same way, except that their serialization
contains their ``width`` and ``height``, and an additional property
``scales`` that contains a mapping with the available image scales.
Image URLs are created using the UID-based URL that changes each time the image
is modified, so these URLs can be properly cached:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "icon": {
        "download": "http://localhost:55001/plone/image/@@images/8eed3f80-5e1f-4115-85b8-650a10a6ca84.png",
        "height": 32,
        "width": 24
      },
      "large": {
        "download": "http://localhost:55001/plone/image/@@images/0d1824d1-2672-4b62-9277-aeb220d3bf15.png",
        "height": 768,
        "width": 576
      },
      "..." : {}
    }


Upload (deserialization)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For file or image fields, the client must provide the file's data as a mapping
containg the file data and some additional metadata:

- ``data`` - the base64 encoded contents of the file
- ``encoding`` - the encoding you used to encode the data, so usually `base64`
- ``content-type`` - the MIME type of the file
- ``filename`` - the name of the file, including extension

.. code-block:: json

      {
        "...": "",
        "@type": "File",
        "title": "My file",
        "file": {
            "data": "TG9yZW0gSXBzdW0uCg==",
            "encoding": "base64",
            "filename": "lorem.txt",
            "content-type": "text/plain"}
      }


Relations
---------

Serialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``RelationValue`` will be serialized to a short summary representation of the referenced object:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "@id": "http://nohost/plone/doc1",
      "@type": "DXTestDocument",
      "title": "Document 1",
      "description": "Description"
    }

The ``RelationList`` containing that reference will be represended as a list in JSON.

Deserialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to set a relation when creating or updating content, you can use one
of several ways to specify relations:

- UID
- path
- URL
- intid

Specify relations by UID:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "relatedItems": [
      "158e5361282647e39bf0698fe238814b",
      "5597250bda4b41eab6ed37cd25fb0979"
    ]
  }

Specify relations by path:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "relatedItems": ["/page1", "/page2"]
  }

Specify relations by URL:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "relatedItems": [
      "http://localhost:8080/Plone/page1",
      "http://localhost:8080/Plone/page2"
    ]
  }

Specify relations by intid:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "relatedItems": [347127075, 347127076]
  }

Next/Previous/Parent Navigation
-------------------------------

The response body of a GET request contains three attributes that allows navigating to the parent and the next and previous sibling in the container the current document is located.

Parent
^^^^^^

The "parent" attribute points to the parent container of the current content object.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "parent": {
      "@id": "http://nohost/plone/folder-with-items", 
      "@type": "Folder", 
      "title": "Folder with items",
      "description": "This is a folder with two documents", 
    }
  }

Previous Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "previous_item" attribute points to the sibling that is located before the current element in the parent container (Plone uses the getObjectPositionInParent attribute to sort content objects within a folderish container).

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "previous_item": {
      "@id": "http://nohost/plone/folder-with-items/item-1", 
      "@type": "Document",
      "title": "Item 1",
      "description": "This the previous item"
    }
  }

Next Item
^^^^^^^^^

The "next_item" attribute points to the sibling that is located after the current element in the parent container (Plone uses the getObjectPositionInParent attribute to sort content objects within a folderish container).

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "next_item": {
      "@id": "http://nohost/plone/folder-with-items/item-2", 
      "@type": "Document",
      "title": "Item 2",
      "description": "This the next item"
    }
  }
