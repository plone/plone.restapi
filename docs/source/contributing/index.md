# Contributing to `plone.restapi`

## Generating documentation examples

This documentation includes examples of requests and responses (http, curl, httpie, and python-requests).
These examples are generated by the documentation tests in `test_documentation.py`.
To generate a new example, add a new test case to `test_documentation.py`, for example `test_documentation_search_fullobjects`, and run the test

```shell
./bin/test -t test_documentation_search_fullobjects
```

This generates the request and the response files in `tests/http-examples/`.

Include them in the documentation using MyST syntax:

````
```{eval-rst}
..  http:example:: curl httpie python-requests
    :request: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/search_fullobjects.req

..  literalinclude:: ../../src/plone/restapi/tests/http-examples/search_fullobjects.resp
    :language: http
```
````

Build the documentation locally to test the rendering by running `./bin/sphinxbuilder`.
Alternatively, you can use Makefile targets:

`docs-clean`
: Clean current and legacy docs build directories, and Python virtual environment

`docs-html`
: Build HTML

`docs-linkcheck`
: Run linkcheck

`docs-linkcheckbroken`
: Run linkcheck and show only broken links

`docs-livehtml`
: Rebuild Sphinx documentation on changes, with live-reload in the browser

`docs-vale`
: Run spell, grammar, and style checks

`docs`
: Build Docs

Make sure you add and commit the generated files in `http-examples`.

## Code Formatting and Testing

To ensure consistent code formatting, it's recommended to have the "black" tool installed locally. You can install it by running the "make" command inside the "plone.restapi" folder. Once installed, you can use "black" to automatically format the code.

The project has a set of dependencies required for its proper functioning. You can install these dependencies by running the "make" command, which will handle the installation process for you.

To run tests locally and ensure your changes don't introduce any issues, use the "make" command followed by "make test". This will execute the test suite and provide test feedback.
