class StaticTime:
    """ContextManager to patch accessor methods that return dynamic timestamps,
    like creation and modification dates, with ones that return static
    timestamps.

    This is needed during testing to get stable serialization output,
    especially during the tests that dump HTTP response examples to the
    filesystem, because the content of those responses would otherwise
    change all the time.

    Specifically monkey-patching a few accessors (getter methods) in a
    targeted way like this was chosen as an alternative to freezing time
    entirely using libraries like `freezegun`, because that approach has
    caused issues in the past with code that assumes a monotonic clock, like
    the generation of ZODB transaction IDs.

    Instead, this helper aims to selectively patch only what we currently
    need to get stable test runs and HTTP response examples.

    The bulk of cases is addressed by patching `creation_date` and
    `modification_date` for Dexterity objects to return static times. In
    addition, a couple other places need some attention.

    These places will be patched on start() (and unpatched on stop()):

        Ensuring the appropriate type (Python datetime vs. Zope DateTime

        necessary.
