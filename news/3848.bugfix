This fixes a regression due to a low Zope form memory limit of 1MB used since Plone 6.0.7.
You can use ``dos_protection`` settings in ``etc/zope.conf`` to change the limit.
See `CMFPlone issue 3848 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3848>`_ and `Zope PR 1142 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1142>`_.
