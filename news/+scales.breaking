The serialization for image fields no longer includes scales with a width larger than the original.
This means that the scales for an image may not include all of the scale sizes defined in the Imaging control panel.
However, this makes them consistent with image scales returned for catalog results,
and avoids unnecessary creation of large scales which add bloat to the database.
