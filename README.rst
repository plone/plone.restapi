Introduction
============

``plone.restapi`` is a RESTful hypermedia API for Plone.


Documentation
=============

https://plonerestapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Getting started
===============

A live demo of Plone 6 with the latest ``plone.restapi`` release is available at:

https://6.demo.plone.org/

An example GET request on the portal root is the following.

.. code-block:: shell

    curl -i https://6.demo.plone.org/ -H "Accept: application/json"

An example POST request to create a new document is the following.

.. code-block:: shell

    curl -i -X POST https://6.demo.plone.org/ \
        -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN" \
        --data-raw '{"@type": "Document", "title": "My Document"}' \
        --user admin:admin

.. note::

    You will need some kind of API browser application to explore the API.
    You will also need to first obtain a basic authorization token.
    We recommend using `Postman <https://www.postman.com/>`_ which makes it easier to obtain a basic authorization token.


Installation
============

Install ``plone.restapi`` by adding it to your buildout.

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]

    # ...

    eggs =
        plone.restapi


…and then running ``bin/buildout``.
